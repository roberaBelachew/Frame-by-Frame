# Frame-by-Frame
The "Frame by Frame" system is meant to be a movie rating and 
recommendation platform that allows both individual and community interaction. 
From a user’s perspective, it offers a single place to discover films, share opinions, 
and organize future viewing. The system’s main aims are storing detailed 
information about movies, such as titles, genre, cast and directors. This information 
provides the foundation for browsing, searching and filtering movies according to the 
users’ preferences.  
In addition to storing movie details, the platform encourages user 
participation. Registered users have the possibility of creating accounts to share 
ideas, opinions and also make recommendations through ratings and comments, 
encouraging movie discussion and building communities. Reviews and ratings also 
contribute to aggregated scores, giving each movie a visible average rating within the 
system.  
Moreover, the platform enables users to create and manage personalized 
watchlists. This feature helps them keep track of movies they plan to watch and 
organize them according to viewing priorities in a structured way. Tagging or 
categorising based on moods supports discovering films which better match specific 
themes or interests of the user.  
Together, all these elements establish a system that is both functional and 
engaging, which combines reliable data storage with interactive features.
